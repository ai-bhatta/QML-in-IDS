# Quantum Machine Learning (QML) for Intrusion Detection (ToN-IoT Dataset)

This repository contains the **basic preprocessing pipeline** for implementing a Quantum Machine Learning based intrusion detection system using the **ToN-IoT dataset**.  
The preprocessing stage prepares the dataset for quantum machine learning experiments by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, balancing classes, scaling features, and splitting the data into training and testing sets.  

> **Note:** Only the **basic preprocessing file** is uploaded here. Further model development, including the full QSVM training and advanced quantum-classical hybrid implementations, is **currently under construction** and will be released in future updates.
